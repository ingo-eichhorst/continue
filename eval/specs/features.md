# Feature List for Continue.dev Benchmarking

## Version 0.1

- Benchmarks can analyse any core functionality from continue.dev that involve LLMs
- Additional Benchmarks should be simple to implement by a One-Shot Prompt

### Performance Evaluation Framework

- Evaluate LLM performance across various coding tasks
- Support for algorithms, debugging, refactoring, documentation generation, and edge case handling
- Independent testing of each Continue.dev feature involving LLMs

### Secure Execution Environment

- Docker-based isolation for secure execution of LLM-generated code as sandboxed environment to prevent security risks
- This is the default which can be disabled

### Comprehensive Metrics

- Performance metrics: latency, cost, accuracy
- Support for custom metrics
- Statistical reporting capabilities (try to be as scientific as possible)

### Dataset Management

- Adapter to include external datasets

### Specific Benchmark Types

#### Unified Diff Generation Testing

- Evaluate quality of generated diffs
- Test apply button functionality
- Measure success rates of applying generated code changes for different LLMs

#### System Prompt Optimization

- Compare different system prompts for various models
- Identify optimal prompts for specific coding tasks

#### Apply Button

- Test if generated code executes successfully
- Evaluate code quality and adherence to standards

#### Prompt Evaluation

- .continuerules evaluation
- .promts evaluation

## Roadmap

### Parallel Execution

- Multi-threaded testing capabilities
- Improve testing efficiency and throughput

### Reporting System

- Terminal and HTML report generation
- Leaderboard for comparing model performance
- Regression tracking

### Advanced Testing Methods

- Multimodal support
- Reinforcement prompt improvement
- A/B testing capabilities
- Human evaluation integration
