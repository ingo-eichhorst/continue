# Continue.dev Benchmarking Framework - High-Level Architecture

## Design Overview

Based on GitHub issue #4906 and community feedback, this architecture implements a **micro-kernel design** focused on **diff generation/application testing** that lives entirely within the `/eval` directory. The framework supports both local and remote data sources while maintaining simplicity for "at home" testing.
