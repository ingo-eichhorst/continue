# TODO 001: Setup `/eval` Directory Structure

## Test-Driven Development Steps

### ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Write test for directory existence**
  - [x] Create `eval/core/test/setup.test.ts`
  - [x] Write test that checks for required directories: `core/`, `plugins/`, `data/`, `config/`, `scripts/`, `reports/`
  - [x] Run test to verify it fails (directories don't exist yet)
  - [x] Create the required directory structure
  - [x] Run test again to verify it passes

- [x] **Write test for package.json structure**
  - [x] Add test in `eval/core/test/setup.test.ts` that validates package.json exists
  - [x] Test should check for required fields: name, version, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies
  - [x] Test should verify TypeScript configuration is present
  - [x] Run test to verify it fails (no package.json exists yet)
  - [x] Create `eval/package.json` with basic structure
  - [x] Run test again to verify it passes

- [x] **Write test for TypeScript configuration**
  - [x] Add test that checks `tsconfig.json` exists in `/eval`
  - [x] Test should validate required compiler options (target, module, strict, etc.)
  - [x] Test should check for include/exclude patterns
  - [x] Run test to verify it fails (no tsconfig.json exists yet)
  - [x] Create `eval/tsconfig.json` with proper configuration
  - [x] Run test again to verify it passes

- [x] **Write test for build scripts functionality**
  - [x] Add test that verifies `npm run build` script exists in package.json
  - [x] Add test that verifies `npm run test` script exists
  - [x] Add test that verifies `npm run dev` script exists for development
  - [x] Run tests to verify they fail (scripts don't exist yet)
  - [x] Add build, test, and dev scripts to package.json
  - [x] Run tests again to verify they pass

- [x] **Write test for required dev dependencies**
  - [x] Add test that checks for TypeScript in devDependencies
  - [x] Add test that checks for Jest testing framework
  - [x] Add test that checks for ts-node for TypeScript execution
  - [x] Add test that checks for @types/node for Node.js types
  - [x] Run tests to verify they fail (dependencies not installed yet)
  - [x] Install required dev dependencies
  - [x] Run tests again to verify they pass

- [x] **Write test for Git ignore configuration**
  - [x] Add test that checks `.gitignore` exists in `/eval`
  - [x] Test should verify `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `reports/` are ignored
  - [x] Test should verify `.env` files are ignored
  - [x] Run test to verify it fails (no .gitignore exists yet)
  - [x] Create `.gitignore` with proper patterns
  - [x] Run test again to verify it passes

- [x] **Write test for core module structure**
  - [x] Add test that checks for `core/index.ts` file existence
  - [x] Add test that checks for `scripts/index.ts` file existence
  - [x] Add test that checks for `plugins/index.ts` file existence
  - [x] Run tests to verify they fail (files don't exist yet)
  - [x] Create placeholder index files with basic exports
  - [x] Run tests again to verify they pass

- [x] **Write test for Jest test setup**
  - [x] Add test that checks `jest.config.js` exists
  - [x] Test should validate Jest is configured for TypeScript
  - [x] Test should check for proper test file patterns
  - [x] Run test to verify it fails (no Jest config exists yet)
  - [x] Create `jest.config.js` with TypeScript support
  - [x] Run test again to verify it passes

### Final Verification ✅
- [x] **Run all setup tests together**
  - [x] Execute `npm test` to run all setup validation tests
  - [x] Verify all tests pass
  - [x] Verify the basic directory structure is functional
  - [x] Verify TypeScript compilation works with `npm run build`

## Summary

✅ **All 23 tests passing**
✅ **Directory structure created and validated**
✅ **TypeScript compilation working**
✅ **Package.json with proper dependencies and scripts**
✅ **Jest testing framework configured**
✅ **Git ignore properly configured**
✅ **Ready for next phase of development**
